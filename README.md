## Day 2: <a id="day-2"></a>
Menu Icon: Used on almost every website by now, simple but impressively animated it becomes a real eye-catcher

#### Take Away:
Using '@keyframes' with animations! 
<code>
@keyframes lineOne-open {
    0% {
        transform: translateY(0px) rotate(0deg);
    }
    50% {
        transform: translateY(23px) rotate(0deg);
    }
    100% {
        transform: translateY(23px) rotate(45deg);
    }
}
</code>

## Day 3: <a id="day-3"></a>
The Pyramide: Not as challenging as the real pyramids in Egypt, but the shadow path is not easy.

### Take Away: 
Using 'clip-path:' property to crop images and shapes! I used the circle() and polygon() methods with clip-path.

## Day 4: <a id="day-4"></a>
Loading: The best are always websites that do not need a loading status. If they do, here would be a calming one.

### Take Away: 
I learned that you can add another value to the 'animation: ' property called 'alternate'. This will cause the animation to go backwards as well so it looks like a loop.

## Day 5: <a id="day-5"></a>
Statistic: In a world of numbers, it is important to be able to interpret them correctly. Beautiful statistics help to capture these data.

### Take Away:
I learned about the 'polyline' element! This element allows you to create line graphs for displaying data.<br>
Note: This challenge is not finished!!


## Day 6: <a id="day-6"></a>
Profile: Who of you knows how many social media profiles you have already created? For a refreshing twist, you can also create one yourself.

### Take Away:
I am getting better with flex displays and flex-directions to styles sections!!
