## Day 1: <a id="day-1"></a>
An easy start into the challenge with a custom build number with gradient.

## Day 2: <a id="day-2"></a>
Menu Icon: Used on almost every website by now, simple but impressively animated it becomes a real eye-catcher
<br><br>

#### Take Away:
Using `@keyframes` with animations! 
<code>
@keyframes lineOne-open {
    0% {
        transform: translateY(0px) rotate(0deg);
    }
    50% {
        transform: translateY(23px) rotate(0deg);
    }
    100% {
        transform: translateY(23px) rotate(45deg);
    }
}
</code>

## Day 3: <a id="day-3"></a>
The Pyramide: Not as challenging as the real pyramids in Egypt, but the shadow path is not easy.
<br><br>

### Take Away: 
Using `clip-path: ` property to crop images and shapes! I used the circle() and polygon() methods with clip-path.

## Day 4: <a id="day-4"></a>
Loading: The best are always websites that do not need a loading status. If they do, here would be a calming one.
<br><br>

### Take Away: 
I learned that you can add another value to the `animation: ` property called `alternate`. This will cause the animation to go backwards as well so it looks like a loop.

## Day 5: <a id="day-5"></a>
Statistic: In a world of numbers, it is important to be able to interpret them correctly. Beautiful statistics help to capture these data.
<br><br>

### Take Away:
I learned about the `polyline` element! This element allows you to create line graphs for displaying data.<br>
Note: This challenge is not finished!!


## Day 6: <a id="day-6"></a>
Profile: Who of you knows how many social media profiles you have already created? For a refreshing twist, you can also create one yourself.
<br><br>

### Take Away:
I am getting better with flex displays and flex-directions to styles sections!!


## Day 7: <a id="day-7"></a>
Notifications, Search and Menu: The three cornerstones of any application? Brought together in the smallest possible space.
<br><br>

### Take Away:
I learned a lot about javaScript in this project. I needed different menus and views to pop up when an item was clicked. I learned how to use EventListeners and querySelectors to interact with the html elements by their class names.


## Day 9: <a id="day-9"></a>
Rainy Night: The perfect time of day and the perfect weather to program in peace. The raindrops even shatter on the ground.
<br><br>

### Take Away:
In this project I learned about using `overflow:hidden` to crop elements that would run over. I also learned how to delay animations with `animation-delay: 1s`


## Day 10: <a id="day-10"></a>
Watch: Classic, noble, modern or playful? What do you want your favorite watch to look like?
<br><br>

### Take Away:
In this project I got a little more comfortable with the `svg` element and starting to see where it is useful. I got to place with the circle version of an svg and used it to make the circling red line animation.


## Day 11: <a id="day-11"></a>
Walking Boots: These boots are made for walking. Where are they going and for how long?
<br><br>

### Take Away:
In this project I worked on keyframe animations again. This time I set more break points to try to make the animation more accurate. Room for improvement would definitely be to figure out how to make the animations smoother!


## Day 12: <a id="day-12"></a>
Tooltip: I'm quite sure, you already know what obsession means. But you can look it up anyways.
<br><br>

### Take Away:
I learned how to use tooltips! There is a hover effect in this project when you go over "Obession" that brings up a tooltip definition for the word.
